        <p className="mb-4">
            I am a passionate JavaScript developer and full-time student at SLIIT.
            With a year of self-taught coding experience, I enjoy building web
            applications and writing about web development as a part-time blogger.
            I'm a fan of open-source contributions and JAMstack technologies, always
            seeking new opportunities to collaborate and grow as a developer.
